Magic List is a module that extends the built-in list type.

[Documentation](https://qexat.github.io/magic-list/) · [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/magic-list/) · [How to install](#installation) · [Notes for contributors and maintainers](./README-dev.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Its development is entirely test-driven: it is battery-tested and requires a
> test coverage of 100%. It also provides type stubs.

## Installation

```sh
pip install magic-list
```

## Examples

### Fibonacci sequence

Let's write a function that given an integer `n`, returns the fibonacci sequence up to the `n`-th member.

For example, `fibonacci_sequence(10)` would return `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]`.

```py
import operator

from magic_list import L, list

def fibonacci_sequence(n: int) -> list[int]:
    # let's start by creating a list with the first two members, 0 and 1.
    base = L[0, 1]

    # we define a function that we will use to generate the next members of
    # the sequence
    def next_member(current: list[int]) -> int:
        return current.take_right(2).sum()

    return base.fill_right(next_member, n - 1)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `L[0, 1]` notation is a way to construct magic lists nicely.
